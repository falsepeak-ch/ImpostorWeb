                <p class="blog-intro">Finding games that work for large groups is frustrating. Most party games cap at 8 players. Others claim to support big groups but become chaotic messes. Here are activities genuinely designed for 10-20+ people, organized by player count and engagement type.</p>

                <div class="blog-section" id="section-0">
                    <h2>Why Large Group Games Are Different</h2>
                    <p>Games for 10+ people face unique challenges. Too much downtime between turns kills energy. Explaining complex rules to 15 people takes forever. Quiet players get lost in the chaos. The best large group games solve these issues with: simultaneous participation (everyone plays at once), simple rules (explained in under 2 minutes), built-in social mixing (everyone interacts with multiple people), flexible player counts (works with 10 or 20), and minimal equipment (not everyone has 20 game controllers).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-section" id="section-1">
                    <h2>Best Games for 10-15 People</h2>
                    <p>Cluso Impostor: The social deduction game designed for large groups. 10-15 players creates the perfect balance - enough chaos to hide impostors, but manageable discussion. Only one device needed. Games last 15-20 minutes. Mafia/Werewolf: The classic that popularized social deduction. Requires a moderator who can't play. Works best with 10-12 players. Free but needs a good moderator. Charades (Team Version): Split into two teams of 5-7. Teams alternate acting. Competition keeps energy high. Needs just paper and a timer. Pictionary (Tournament Style): Multiple teams draw simultaneously. Fastest team to guess wins the round. Works with standard Pictionary or improvised. Catchphrase: Teams pass a device and give clues to words. When the timer beeps, the holding team loses. Scalable and fast-paced.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-section" id="section-2">
                    <h2>Best Games for 15-20 People</h2>
                    <p>Cluso Impostor (Large Mode): With 15-20 players, Cluso becomes delightfully chaotic. More impostors hide among more innocents. Discussions become intense debates. The game scales perfectly - larger groups just mean longer but more exciting discussions. Two Rooms and a Boom: Split into two rooms. Each team has a secret president. Opposite team has a bomber. Through timed exchanges, teams try to win. Needs 2 rooms and a moderator. Mafia (Extended): With more players, add more roles: doctor, detective, vigilante. Increases complexity but also engagement. Still requires a skilled moderator. Human Knot: Everyone grabs two random hands in the circle. Must untangle without letting go. Physical and hilarious. No equipment needed. Heads Up Categories: Large group shouts items in a category. First to pause loses. Elimination style until one winner remains.</p>

                <div class="blog-section" id="section-3">
                    <h2>Games That Scale Infinitely</h2>
                    <p>These work with any large number and can even accommodate 30+ players. Assassin: Everyone gets a secret target. 'Kill' your target by winking at them. They're out and you inherit their target. Last assassin standing wins. Plays out over hours or days. Telephone (Drawing Version): Start with a phrase. Person 1 draws it. Person 2 guesses the drawing. Person 3 draws that guess. By person 20, it's unrecognizable. Hilarious results. Just needs paper and pens. Silent Line-Up: Without speaking, line up by birthday, height, or another criterion. Communication without words. Teamwork building. Scavenger Hunt (Team-Based): Create teams of 4-5. List of items to photograph or collect. First team with everything wins. Works for any location. Would You Rather (Debate Version): Pose dilemmas. Each side debates their position. Anyone can switch sides based on arguments. Reveals reasoning and creates discussion.</p>

                    <h2>Why Cluso Dominates for Large Groups</h2>
                    <p>Most party games struggle with 10+ players. Cluso Impostor was specifically designed to excel with large groups. Here's why it works: One device for everyone - no buying 15 copies or controllers. Dynamic scaling - algorithm adjusts impostor count based on players. Simultaneous engagement - everyone participates in discussion phase, zero downtime. Perfect for mixed groups - works if half the people are introverts. Quick rounds - even with 20 players, games finish in 20-25 minutes. No moderator needed - unlike Mafia, everyone can play. Built-in ice breaking - forces everyone to interact naturally. It's the rare game that actually gets BETTER with more players rather than worse.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-section" id="section-5">
                    <h2>Managing Large Group Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Size creates challenges beyond just the game choice. Make sure everyone can hear: Use a microphone for 15+ people or move to a smaller room. Even sound levels prevent the loudest from dominating. Prevent cliques: Actively mix up people who arrived together. The point of large group games is meeting new people, not hanging with your existing friends. Handle quiet players: Create explicit space for them. In Cluso, go around the circle to ensure everyone speaks. In other games, use talking sticks or turn orders. Set time limits: With 15 people sharing thoughts, set 30-second limits or discussions drag forever. Use a visible timer. Split when needed: Some activities work better with two simultaneous games of 10 than one game of 20. Read the room.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-section" id="section-6">
                    <h2>Equipment Considerations for Large Groups</h2>
                    <p>Running games for 20 people can get expensive. Prioritize these solutions: Phone/tablet games (like Cluso): One device costs nothing extra regardless of player count. Versus buying 20 board game pieces. DIY materials: Paper, pens, and timers replace most commercial games. Write your own Charades prompts or Pictionary words. Team-based sharing: Divide 20 people into 4 teams of 5. Teams share one set of materials. Reduces costs dramatically. Projection: If using a device with a large group, connect to a TV or projector so everyone can see clearly. Free games first: Before buying expensive large-group games, exhaust free options. Many work just as well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-section" id="section-7">
                    <h2>Common Large Group Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                    <p>Don't overexplain rules: With 15 people watching you explain, keep it under 2 minutes. Learn by playing. Don't let one person dominate: Designate a facilitator to gently redirect if needed. Democracy dies in large groups without management. Don't skip breaks: After 45-60 minutes, people need bathroom/drink breaks. Factor this in. Don't choose complex games: Simple games like Cluso work better than complex strategy games requiring deep explanation. Don't forget about space: 20 people need physical room. Games with movement need even more.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-conclusion">
                    <p>Large group games aren't just 'games that technically allow more players.' The best ones, like Cluso Impostor, are specifically designed to harness the energy and chaos of big groups into amazing experiences. Whether you're hosting 10 people or 20, having a reliable large-group game in your toolkit transforms impossible hosting situations into unforgettable parties. Download Cluso and discover why it's the go-to game for big gatherings!</p>
