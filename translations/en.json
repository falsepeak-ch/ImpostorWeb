        "content": [
          {"heading": "What Are Social Deduction Games?", "text": "Social deduction games pit informed minorities against uninformed majorities. Typically, a few players are secretly designated as 'bad guys' who know each other's identities. The majority 'good guys' must identify and eliminate the infiltrators through discussion, voting, and deduction. The tension between deception and detection creates intense psychological gameplay."},
          {"heading": "The History: From Mafia to Modern Games", "text": "The genre began with Mafia (also called Werewolf) created in 1986 by Dmitry Davidoff in Russia. Players would gather in person, close their eyes, and the 'mafia' would silently choose victims. The game spread globally through the 1990s. The 2000s saw digital adaptations like Town of Salem. Then Among Us exploded in 2020, bringing the genre to millions. Today, games like Cluso Impostor refine the formula for in-person play."},
          {"heading": "Core Mechanics That Define the Genre", "text": "All social deduction games share key elements: hidden roles, asymmetric information, discussion phases, voting/elimination, and win conditions based on majority control. The magic happens in the discussion phase where players analyze behavior, statements, and voting patterns to deduce hidden information."},
          {"heading": "Why They're So Addictive", "text": "Social deduction games tap into deep psychological drives. They test our ability to lie convincingly and detect lies in others. Every game creates unique stories and memorable moments. The games scale well from small to large groups. No two games play the same way because human behavior is unpredictable."},
          {"heading": "Digital vs In-Person Versions", "text": "Among Us proved social deduction works digitally with visual tasks and emergency meetings. However, in-person games like Cluso Impostor offer advantages: reading body language, no technical barriers, and genuine social connection. The best choice depends on whether your group is local or remote."},
          {"heading": "Tips for New Players", "text": "Start with simpler games like Cluso Impostor before complex variants. Focus on observing behavior, not just words. Don't take accusations personally - it's part of the game. As an innocent, avoid random voting. As an impostor, stay calm and consistent."},
          {"heading": "The Future of Social Deduction", "text": "The genre continues evolving with new mechanics and themes. Mobile apps like Cluso make in-person games more accessible. Virtual reality may add new dimensions. The core appeal - testing your social instincts against friends - ensures these games will remain popular for years to come."}
        ],
        "conclusion": "From Mafia's humble origins to Among Us's viral success, social deduction games have proven their staying power. Whether you prefer digital or in-person, games like Cluso Impostor offer endless entertainment through psychological gameplay and social interaction. Try one at your next gathering and discover why millions are hooked!"
